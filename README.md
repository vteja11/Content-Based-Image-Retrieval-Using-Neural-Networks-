# Content-Based-Image-Retrieval-Using-Neural-Networks-

Content based image retrieval (CBIR) is a well known technique to retrieve images from a large and unlabeled database. However the conventional techniques are not accurate and reliable .An efficient and reliable image retrieval system is developed based on the use of neural networks (NNs). It takes advantages of association ability of multilayer NNs as matching engines which calculate similarities between a user's input image(query) and the stored images. The NNs memorize pixel information of every image (thumbnail) in the learning phase. In the retrieval phase, pixel information of a user's query is inputted to the learned NNs and they estimate the candidates. Thus the system can retrieve candidates quickly and correctly by utilizing the parallelism and association ability of NeuralNetworks. In addition, the system has learning capability: it can automatically extract features of a user's query during the retrieval phase and can store them as additional information to improve the performance. The software for querying, including efficient graphical user interfaces, has been implemented and tested.
